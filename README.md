# Data-Cleaning-with-SQL

This project, titled **"Data Cleaning with SQL"** focuses on transforming messy and unstructured data into a clean, reliable, and analysis-ready format using SQL. It involves applying a series of systematic steps to address common data quality issues, such as standardizing inconsistent formats, resolving missing or null values, and removing duplicates. By leveraging SQL's robust querying capabilities, the project ensures data is optimized for downstream tasks like reporting, visualization, and advanced analytics. The process begins with exploring and profiling the dataset to identify anomalies, followed by implementing logical solutions tailored to address each issue.

Key transformations in this project include converting date formats for consistency, breaking down composite address fields into structured components (like street, city, and state), and standardizing categorical fields (e.g., changing "Y" and "N" to "Yes" and "No"). Additionally, the project employs advanced SQL techniques, such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions, to handle more complex cleaning tasks, like calculating rolling aggregates and identifying redundant entries. Temporary tables and views are also utilized to enhance efficiency and facilitate iterative testing of changes, ensuring accuracy and transparency throughout the process.

By employing SQL for data cleaning, this project showcases proficiency in database management and highlights the importance of data quality in driving actionable insights. The concise, scalable approach used ensures the results are reliable and can easily integrate into larger data workflows.
